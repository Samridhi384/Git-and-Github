there are many times we want to see the changes in staged area and working directory 
or what was before and what are now the changes

basically it shows any changes in unstaged area

A is staging area (has - sign) vs
B is working directory (has + sign)

now after just add . command
git diff will not give anything as now staging area and working directory is same 

now git diff HEAD will give differences as before it will show both whether staged or unstaged

but after commit both command will return nothing


git diff --cached
will show only difference between Staging Area(=Index) and Head

--staged : --cached 
 and here after git diff will show nothing as nothing is present in unstaged area everything is staged

 to compare two branches
 git  diff branch1..branch2
 and 
 git diff branch2..branch1 here order does matter

to compare two commits
 git diff commit1..commit2
  here we take hash id's of the commits

Run a diff to compare the current HEAD to the previous commit = 
 git diff HEAD HEAD~1
