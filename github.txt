suppose we want to push content from some branch to master branch so we use
git push origin cats:master

git push origin -u master
-u is for upstream , it means that the local and remote branches are now linked.  
and next time we can simply write git push and it will understand 

and next they have same name like in local dogs name is there so it will connect with dog branch
