We merge branches, not specific commits
We always merge to the current HEAD branch

git merge oldies  to fast forward merge

The content from your current HEAD (the branch you
 are trying to merge content into) is displayed
 between the  <<<<<<< HEAD  and  =======
 (in the branch we are right now)


Conflict Markers
 The content from the branch you are trying to merge
 from is displayed between the ======= and 
>>>>>>> symbols.
(from the branch we are trying to merge)

git checkout -b silence  to switch and create branch

Fast forward merge means to merge the branch with master without doing any changes in master
simply means to do all the changes in the branch and then simply merge

and in merge commit we first commit all the changes and then merge it  to another branch
