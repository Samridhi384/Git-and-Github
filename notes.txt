Git is a Version control system that is a vcs is something which can track and manage the changes of file

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency

Git can stand for global information tracker

ls , cd 
type nul > file.txt = to create new file
start . =  to open the folders
start Desktop to see what is inside Desktop
ls Desktop also be used

ls Desktop/Pets

pwd = my current location where i am right now

 touch purple.js = can also be used to create new file

 mkdir yellow cyan = makes new directory or folders , it avoids creating duplicate videos

 rm purple.js = it permanentaly deletes the file and not folders

 ls -a is used to show hidden directories

 rm -rf used to delete a folder permanentaly

next we can do git init , git status . git add . ,  git commit -m "initial commit"
 
each commit should focus on one single thing

suppose u forgot to add a file or made a typo 
 git commit -m 'some commit'
 git add forgotten_file
 git commit --amend

so if we want to commit again after some changes and we write
git commit and it will open to vim editor here press i to insert message and press esc & :wq q to quit and w to write and save
