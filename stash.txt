many times we work in other branch and suddenly we want to switch to masters branch but i am not ready to commit the changes yet in my other branch so for that we can use git stash

to save = git stash save = git stash
to remove = git stash pop

git stash apply = to auto merge with other branch and have stashed changes

we can use multiple git stash 
we can get list with git stash list

git stash apply stash@{2}  
git stash drop stash@{2} to drop particular stress

but in the end mostly git stash and git stash pop are used
